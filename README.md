Teachable Machine is Google‚Äôs AutoML platform which is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.
After doing the same, you can download the trained model and use it for your applications. And also accessible to everyone.

<p align:"center" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0 50px; font-size: 20px;" >

The artificial intelligence model I developed solves the problem of distinguishing objects. Artificial intelligence is so smart that it has the capacity to distinguish objects easily. I took 200 photos for each object. And with these 200 photographs, he can figure out which object belongs to which class. Thanks to this, life becomes easier.
